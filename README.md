# CardHand

Created with Unity 2018.2.0f2

Card assets do not belong to me, and should not be used in any projects for any reason. They are placeholders only.

## Known Issues
* The Unity EventSystem uses Y coordinates to choose next selectable. Because the cards are arched using the Y coordinate, the selection using the controller is broken. Mouse selection works fine.
